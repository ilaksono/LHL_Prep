        <h3>Recipe Preparation</h3>

        <strong>Laksa Paste</strong>
        <div class = "prep">
        <p>Place dried chiles in a small <em>heatproof</em> bowl, add boiling water to cover, and let soak until <em>softened</em>, 12–15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, heat a large dry saucepan over medium-high. Cook ginger and garlic, stirring occasionally, until lightly charred and garlic is just tender, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a clean surface; peel garlic.</p>
        <p>Purée reserved chiles, Thai chiles, shallots, lemongrass, oil, shrimp paste, coriander, curry powder, cumin, ginger, and garlic in a food processor or blender until smooth (it’s okay if a few flecks of chile remain).</p>
    </div>
        <strong>Soup</strong>
        <div class = "prep">
        <p>Heat oil in a <em>large</em> saucepan over <em>medium-high</em>. Cook laksa paste, stirring often, until paste is slightly darkened and begins to slide around saucepan when stirred, about 2 minutes. Add half of coconut milk and cook, stirring, until reduced by half, 4–6 minutes. Add stock, tofu puffs, if using, and remaining coconut milk. Bring to a boil; add chicken. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through and tender, 20–25 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and let cool; shred meat.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions.</p>

        <p>Add chicken and sugar to soup; season with salt. Divide soup and noodles among bowls. Top with eggs and cucumbers; serve with toppings.
